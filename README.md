# BerlitzGenetic

**BerlitzGenetic** is a simple genetic programming library written in Java. It allows users to evolve solutions for optimization and symbolic regression problems by leveraging genetic algorithms. This project is created for personal use and experimentation.

## Features
- Basic genetic programming operators (crossover, mutation)
- Extensible framework for custom fitness functions
- Adjustable parameters for population size, mutation rate, and crossover rate
- Simple and intuitive
